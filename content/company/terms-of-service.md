# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025_

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of **PPClicks** and any services we provide, including Google Ads management, audits, landing page development, and reporting.

By using our services, you agree to these Terms.

- Google Ads campaign setup, optimization, and management  
- Performance tracking and reporting  
- Landing page design consultation  
- Strategic recommendations for account growth  

All details, scope, and pricing are defined in your service agreement.

## 2. Client Responsibilities

To deliver effective results, you agree to:

- Provide accurate business and billing information  
- Maintain active access to your Google Ads account

Failure to do so may impact performance and timelines.

## 3. Payments & Billing

- Campaign ad spend is billed directly by Google (not PPClicks)

## 4. Performance Disclaimer

We aim for measurable improvements, but **no marketing agency can guarantee specific results**, such as a fixed number of conversions, revenue, or cost-per-lead.

Performance depends on variables such as competition, budget, creative quality, landing page experience, and external market conditions.

## 5. Intellectual Property

Campaign structures, strategies, landing pages, and creative assets produced by PPClicks remain our intellectual property unless specified otherwise in writing.

Clients may use them solely for their own business purposes.

## 6. Termination of Service

Either party may terminate the agreement with written notice as specified in the service contract.

Upon termination:

- Work already completed remains billable  
- Future services will be discontinued  
- Access permissions (Ads Manager, Analytics, etc.) may be removed  

## 7. Limitation of Liability

PPClicks is not liable for:

- Loss of revenue, profits, or business  
- Issues caused by platform outages (Google Ads, Analytics, etc.)  
- Client-side changes to campaigns, budgets, or assets  
- External market shifts beyond our control  

Our maximum liability shall not exceed the total fees paid in the last 30 days.

## 8. Policy Updates

We may revise these Terms when necessary. Continued use of our services means acceptance of the updated Terms.
